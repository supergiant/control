Empower developers and administrators through simplified deployment and management of Kubernetes. Supergiant facilitates clusters on multiple cloud providers, striving for agnostic infrastructure--with an autoscaling system that cares about efficiency. It asserts through autoscaling that every pod should have a home, but that underutilized infrastructure shouldn't be paid for (and, therefore, shouldn't be running).

# Features

  * Vanilla, Certified Kubernetes, with versions (What versions?)
  * Places users can deploy kubes (AWS, GCE, etc.?)
  * A microservice that can be installed independently of the SG toolkit
  * Easy creation of Helm releases, Pods, Services, LoadBalancers, etc. (is this true?)
  * Role-based Users, Session-based logins, self-signed SSLs, and API tokens
