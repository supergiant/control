The Supergiant toolkit—Control, Capacity, and Analyze—is built to simplify the administration and operation of Kubernetes. Each tool is rooted in a desire to blaze better trails in DevOps, to put the power of enterprise systems in the hands of any aspiring team or tinkerer.

* Control is the mothership through which clusters can be created, adopted, and modified. It simplifies deployment of Helm releases and provides at-a-glance metrics for cluster resources.

* Capacity asserts through hardware autoscaling that every pod should have a home—but that underutilized infrastructure should not be paid for (and, therefore, should not be running).

* Analyze takes the cumulative experience of our team’s efforts to maximize cluster workloads, and it provides presets and custom “checks” to promote efficiency for applications.

Each tool has a separate UI and API, to give more freedom to end users of all skill levels, or each tool can be used together, in one UI, with Supergiant Control. (_This repository contains Supergiant **Control**._)

# Features of Control

  * Vanilla, **Certified** Kubernetes (version `1.11.1`)
  * Easy creation of and access to Helm releases
  * AWS and Digital Ocean support with easy cloud account setup
  * At-a-glance metrics of cluster resource usage
  * Pluggability for Capacity and Analyze
  * A UI and API designed for user experience
